### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello! I'm Yashika. I thrive in the realm of the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack and have a deep passion for exploring innovative technologies and methodologies. My toolkit includes the likes of ReactJS, Jamstack (JavaScript, APIs + Markup), Redux, among others. I'm also passionate about  Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), which forms the backbone of efficient and optimized software development.
